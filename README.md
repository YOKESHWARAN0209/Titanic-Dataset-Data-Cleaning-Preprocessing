# Titanic-Dataset-Data-Cleaning-Preprocessing
This project cleans the Titanic dataset for machine learning. It involves handling missing values via imputation, one-hot encoding categorical features (Sex, Embarked), standardizing numerical columns (Age, Fare), and removing outliers with the IQR method to produce a model-ready dataset.
